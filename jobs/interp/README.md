These scripts interpolate the GCM data where the _hist references the historical reference timeframe and the other scripts interpolate the projected data.

NOTE SHOULD USE tas directly from GCM model!!!!! I applied the AWRAL average arbitrarily so this needs to change!!!!!!

The numbers represent variables:

None: tasmax
1: tas
2: tasmin
3: rsds
4: pr
5: sfcWind
