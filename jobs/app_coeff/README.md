The numbers represent variables:

None: tasmax
1: tas
2: tasmin
3: rsds
4: pr
5: sfcWind


HAVE TO RUN tas first before tasmax and tasmin

NEED more memory- I'm getting memory errors running on compute nodes.. maybe this means that we need to limit the reference period we are using to apply the bias correction
