The numbers represent variables:

None: tasmax
1: tas
2: tasmin
3: rsds
4: pr
5: sfcWind

All these scripts do:

1. Name changes
2. Unit changes
3. Unit conversions

Need to run tasmin and tasmax first before tas (avg) as these get sorted into actual min and max in the tas script.

Uses the AWRAL formula for average temp.

NOTE NEED TO INFILL SOLAR FORCING!
